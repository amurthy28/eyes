# eyes
This project uses the mouse tracking feature of javascript plus the styling of css to create the image of eyes tracking the cursor. 

How to run: Drag the html file onto a new tab in a browser. Move the cursor around the screen and the eyes will follow the cursor. 

Ways to improve: Add a button which adds and removes eyes.
